## Model Performance (Example Results)
| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 86%      | 82%       | 78%    | 80%      |
| Random Forest       | 90%      | 88%       | 84%    | 86%      |
| XGBoost             | 92%      | 89%       | 87%    | 88%      |

*Note: These are example scores. Actual results may vary depending on hyperparameters and data split.*
