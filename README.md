 Churn Prediction Project ðŸ“Š

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting customer churn (from kaggle) using supervised machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The goal is to identify customers likely to leave a subscription-based service, enabling proactive customer retention strategies.

## Model Performance (Example Results)
| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.73     | 0.49      | 0.79   | 0.61     |
| Random Forest       | 0.76     | 0.53      | 0.76   | 0.63     |
| XGBoost             | 0.72     | 0.49      | 0.82   | 0.61     |

*Note: These are example scores. Actual results may vary depending on hyperparameters and data split.*
